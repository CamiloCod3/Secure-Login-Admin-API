# FastAPI Secure Login & Admin API üöÄüîê

Welcome to my FastAPI Secure Login & Admin API project! üéâ This started as a learning adventure into the world of API security, and it‚Äôs packed with practical features like secure user authentication, rate limiting, and a few other tricks for keeping things safe and smooth. This project isn‚Äôt just a simple API‚Äîit‚Äôs a roadmap for anyone interested in getting serious about security in modern API development.

## About This Project

This API combines essential security features like JWT-based token authentication, rate limiting, and secure cookie handling to create a sturdy base for login and admin management. It‚Äôs designed as a learning tool and a starting point for projects that need a solid foundation in API security. Some parts may seem a bit over-the-top for smaller projects, but they showcase patterns that can be adapted to real-world use.

*Use this as a playground for learning, testing, and evolving API security skills‚Äîit‚Äôs all about making it work securely, but with the option to adapt as you grow!*

## Core Features

- **FastAPI Power**: Fast and effective for building APIs‚Äîno one likes a laggy server!
- **OAuth 2.0 & JWTs**: Fort Knox level security for user sessions, with access and refresh tokens stored in cookies for added protection.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Reliable and efficient data storage to back the API.
- **Rate Limiting**: Avoids abuse by capping requests, fully customizable to meet specific needs.
- **SSL Ready**: Secure connections all the way‚Äîideal for a production environment.
- **Clean, Modular Code**: Built to be maintainable and easy to extend as needed.

## Quick Start

### Essentials

You‚Äôll need the following to get started:

- **Python 3.11+**: For the latest features.
- **PostgreSQL**: Our database of choice for storing user data.
- **Docker** (Optional): To make deployment a breeze.

### Setup & Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SecureLogin_FastAPI.git
   cd SecureLogin_FastAPI
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment**:
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, then add your secrets.

4. **Launch the Server**:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

5. **Optional Docker Deployment**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## Security Features

This API is built with security at its core, showcasing key techniques to protect data and enforce access controls:

- **Password Hashing**: Ensures passwords are stored safely.
- **Token-based Auth**: Managed with JWT tokens for secure, verified access.
- **SSL Configuration**: Keeps connections encrypted and data safe.
- **Input Validation**: Blocks unwanted inputs, keeping the API secure and reliable.

### Going Beyond: Production Considerations

To deploy this in a production setting, consider adapting a few elements based on your needs:

- **Token Management**: A single access token might be enough for some use cases, or consider external providers like Auth0 or AWS Cognito.
- **Dynamic Rate Limiting**: Tailor rate limits by user roles for even more control.
- **API Gateway**: Offloading tasks like rate limiting to a gateway (e.g., AWS API Gateway) can help with scalability and reduce backend load.
